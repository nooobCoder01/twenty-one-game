# twenty-one-game
Twenty One is a game of chance where players take turns rolling dice and tallying the results until they decide to stop rolling and lock in their score, or end up going bust with a total over 21. The objective is to be the closest to 21 when everyone is done rolling.

Rules are as following:
- Players begin with a score of 0.
- Each player has one turn to either roll or stop rolling each round.
- Players can only do a regular roll of two dice until they 
  reach a score of at least 14.
- Players with a score >= 14 have the option to only roll one dice.
- If a player scores more than 21 they go bust and are out of the game.
- The winning player is the one with the score closest to 21 when everyone 
  has finished rolling.
- If all players go bust, no one wins.
- If more than one player has the winning score, no one wins.
